1st edition:

Wittgenstein splits personality with Lewis Carroll :)

Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland generate gems such as:

"and most things twinkled after that only the description of these propositions an expression is a contradiction that they are one could say what we want to see if she had looked under it and finding it very hard indeed to make it stop well i'd hardly finished the guinea pigs who were lying round the neck of the world not the right and wrong but the possibility of expressing yourself the baby the fire and at last and managed to put down the rabbit in fact completely congruent and the possibility of denial etc one could of course"

"the argument just as one says there are equal numbers of things individuals but between what numbers and how do you call it purring not growling said alice allow me to invent them there cannot be contained in those of the expression of the signs etc which have no notion how long ago and how odd the directions will look alice's right foot esq hearthrug near the king say in a few minutes and began to feel a little tis so said alice in a long silence broken only by being pictures of him while the rest waited in silence was"


2nd edition:

Beckett's Malone dies splits personality with Leonid Andreyev's Satan's Diary

"cream my head buzzed madly pulling up that accursed sleeve madly and waving it like a drunken soldier at a drum and how do i know not what we have chosen for ourselves these solemn american faces had we looked around more carefully we might have to move or to day i found myself here i am not in the tragedy suddenly a dream and think of the house of saint john of god but stern measures were simply flattering my american face which all that was clear and under the influence of these walls that i used to"
